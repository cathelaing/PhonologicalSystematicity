# PhonologicalSystematicity

Data and code for the project 'Phonological Systematicity in Early Phonological Development' (Laing, in prep).

Code is currently in development. Updates to appear shortly!

This project draws on work from Fourtassi et al. (2020) to expand their consideration of Preferential Attachment (PAT) vs. Preferential Acquisition (PAC) in early word learning. Phonological network analysis on *infants' actual productions* will observe the data in relation to these two contrasting theoretical frameworks. Data from 5 American infants is analysed (Providence Corpus; Demuth et al., 2006) to analyse over 140,000 word productions between ages 0;11 and 3;0. Euclidean distance is used to compare each word produced within a session with each other word within the same session. This will provide a view of how connected early productions (as oppose to target forms in Fourtassi et al. 2018) are within a child's lexicon, and how this connectedness changes over time.
